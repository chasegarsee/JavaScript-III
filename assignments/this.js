/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*  
           "WINDOW/GLOBAL OBJECT BINDING"
* 1. Whenever a function is contained in the global scope, 
     the value of THIS inside of that function will be the window object.
       
            "IMPLICIT (automatic) BINDING"
     * 2. Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, 
     the object before that dot is THIS.

            "NEW BINDING"
     * 3. Whenever a constructor function is used, 
          THIS refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.

                USING CALL/APPLY
          * 4. Whenever JavaScriptâ€™s call or apply method is used, THIS is explicitly defined.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
